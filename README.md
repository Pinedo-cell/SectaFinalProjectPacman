## Inteligent Systems Final Group Practice

This practice aim is to create different algorithms in order to learn how teach and ai to play pacman.

# FirstAttempt to Reinforcement learning: 
The website where we have found the archives and we have been following the tutorial of Reinforcement Learning is the following: https://www.cse.huji.ac.il/~ai/reinforcement/reinforcement.html

We have modified the following .py archives: 
valueIterationAgents.py	(A value iteration agent for solving known MDPs.)
qlearningAgents.py	(Q-learning agents for Gridworld, Crawler and Pac-Man)

To make Pacman Learn in the Pacman original grid game you should run the following .py with the commands below: 
python3 pacman.py -p ApproximateQAgent -a extractor=SimpleExtractor -x 50 -n 60 -l originalClassic
