Steps of the Google Colaboratory file:

1. This takes in-game screen and outputs the probabilities of each of the actions.

2. Feed preprocessed input images of the game space and acquire the initial probability distribution of actions.

3. Select the action with the highest probability.

4. Select actions and evalatue the decisions taken.

5. Store information and repeat steps 2-4.

6. See target and values.

7. Calculate the loss.

8. Evaluate the performance.

Once it is finished, the last iteration is shown as a video and you can see it or download it to see the results obtained.
